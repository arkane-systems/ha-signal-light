# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Accent & Signal Light is a Home Assistant custom integration (`custom_components/signal_light/`) that
manages accent and notification lights using a three-layer priority model, avoiding the need for
bookkeeping automations that track "which automation last changed this light." Domain: `signal_light`
(unchanged from the integration's original name — see below). Platforms: `light`, `sensor`. No external
dependencies beyond Home Assistant core.

The integration was originally published as "Signal Light" but renamed to "Accent & Signal Light" to
avoid confusion with an unrelated, similarly-named existing integration. Only the display name and the
GitHub repo (`ha-accent-signal-light`) changed — the domain, entity IDs, service names, and all
`hass.data`/config-entry internals deliberately still use `signal_light`, since changing the domain
would break every existing installation's config entries, entity registry, and automations (see git
history for the rejected alternative). Don't "finish the rename" by touching the domain.

## Development workflow

There is no build, test, or lint pipeline in this repo — it's a pure HA integration validated only by
HA's own integration loader at runtime. Development/verification is done by:

1. Copying `custom_components/signal_light/` into a Home Assistant instance's `custom_components/`.
2. Restarting HA and adding the integration via **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**.
3. Exercising it through the HA UI, automations, or the four `signal_light.*` services, and checking
   HA's log for errors.

## Architecture

### The three-layer model

The integration wraps one physical light entity (or light group) in a priority model evaluated
top-down; the highest non-empty layer controls the physical light:

1. **Signal layer** — short-lived notifications (doorbell, timer). A priority queue; highest-priority
   active signal wins.
2. **Accent layer** — long-lived overrides (movie mode, holiday theme). A priority stack; highest-
   priority active accent wins when no signal is active.
3. **Base layer** — the default ambient state, exposed as a standard HA `light` entity. Active only
   when accent and signal layers are empty.

Accent/signal entries are plain dicts: `{"name": str, "priority": int, "attrs": dict}`. Both
collections are kept sorted by `priority` descending (index 0 is always the active entry);
insertion/deletion are O(n), which is fine given the expected <10 entries per instance. `name` acts as
a primary key — setting an existing name replaces the entry in place.

### Core components

- **`coordinator.py`** — `SignalLightCoordinator`, a custom coordinator (not HA's polling-oriented
  `DataUpdateCoordinator`) that owns all mutable state and is the single place state transitions
  happen. Every mutation calls `_async_apply_state()`, which evaluates the effective state top-down and
  calls `light.turn_on()`/`light.turn_off()` on the underlying entity with `blocking=True`. If the
  underlying entity isn't available yet at startup, apply calls are deferred until the coordinator
  observes it becoming available. Before `turn_on`, color attributes are normalized so only one of
  `color_name`, `hs_color`, `rgb_color`, `rgbw_color`, `rgbww_color`, `xy_color`, or
  `color_temp_kelvin` is ever sent.
- **`light.py`** — `SignalBaseLight`, the base-layer light entity exposed to users/automations. Extends
  `RestoreEntity` so base-layer state survives restarts (accent/signal layers are intentionally *not*
  persisted — they're expected to be repopulated by automations, e.g. on `homeassistant.start`).
  Mirrors capability metadata (`supported_color_modes`, `supported_features`, `effect_list`,
  `min_color_temp_kelvin`/`max_color_temp_kelvin`) from the underlying light so UI controls stay
  aligned with the real hardware/group. Also hosts the entity-service handlers.
- **`sensor.py`** — four sensor entities: Active Signal, Active Accent, Signal Queue, Accent Stack.
  Each reports via both `state` and `extra_state_attributes`.
- **`__init__.py`** — `async_setup_entry`/`async_unload_entry`. Creates the coordinator, stores it in
  `hass.data[DOMAIN][entry.entry_id]`, forwards setup to platforms, and registers the four domain
  services as *entity services* on the `light` platform (not domain-level), so HA validates/routes
  `entity_id`/`device_id` targets automatically and multiple instances stay fully isolated.
- **`config_flow.py`** — UI setup flow; the config entry stores one key,
  `CONF_UNDERLYING_ENTITY_ID` (the physical light's `entity_id`).
- **`const.py`** — every string literal that appears in more than one place, or that carries semantic
  meaning beyond a plain dict key (domain, config keys, `hass.data` keys, service/field names, sensor
  suffixes, defaults). Use these constants rather than hardcoding duplicated strings.

### Listener pattern

Entities register a callback with the coordinator in `async_added_to_hass` and deregister in
`async_will_remove_from_hass`. The coordinator invokes all registered listeners (no arguments) after
every mutation, and each listener calls `write_ha_state()` on its entity.

### Entity IDs

For an instance named "Living Room": `light.living_room_signal_light_base`,
`sensor.living_room_signal_light_active_signal`, `..._active_accent`, `..._signal_queue`,
`..._accent_stack` — all grouped under one HA device.

## Conventions

- Validation uses `voluptuous`, with schemas defined at module level (not inline). The light-attribute
  schema is duplicated deliberately between `__init__.py` and `light.py` (`_LIGHT_ATTR_SCHEMA`),
  including `color_name`.
- All integration code is async (`async def`/`await`); use the `@callback` decorator from
  `homeassistant.core` for synchronous callbacks.
- `_LOGGER = logging.getLogger(__name__)` per module; DEBUG for routine operations, INFO/ERROR for
  notable events.

## Adding a new service

1. Add the service name constant to `const.py`.
2. Define its voluptuous schema in `__init__.py`.
3. Register it in `async_setup_entry()` in `__init__.py`.
4. Implement the handler on `SignalBaseLight` in `light.py`, delegating to a coordinator method for the
   actual state mutation.
5. Document the schema in `services.yaml`.
